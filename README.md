# BrawlhallaMouseCenterer

## Problem:
Brawlhalla does not have exclusive fullscreen. As a mouse player, I find myself frequently (several times per game) clicking off of the game onto a second monitor. This programs forces the mouse to be stuck on a single position, only when tabbed into the game.

## Using:
1. Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Bobakanoosh/BrawlhallaMouseCenterer/releases) page
2. Download the latest `BrawlhallaMouseCenterer.exe`, or build it yourself
3. Whenever you're playing, run the `.exe`
4. Hit `F5` to toggle the script. It will auto toggle when you tab out.
